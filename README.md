## P-Bench

Code for ACL 2024 paper: P-Bench: A Multi-level Privacy Evaluation Benchmark for Language Models

**TODO**

We are working on code cleaning and our code for membership inference attacks, data extraction attacks and embedding inversion attacks will be uploaded soon.

1. Improve code readability (In Progress)
2. Add backdoor attacks on generative LLMs ❌




**Support Features** 

1. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (🤗PEFT) + PrivacyEngine (Opacus) ✅
2. Membership Inference Attacks ✅
3. Training Data Extraction Attacks ✅
4. Embedding Inversion Attacks ✅



## Preparation

1. numpy
2. torch
3. transformers
4. wandb
5. tqdm
6. typing
7. ml-swissknife
8. datasets
